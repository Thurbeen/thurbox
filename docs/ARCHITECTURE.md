# Architecture Decisions

Each decision follows a mini-ADR format:
**Choice**, **Why**, **Rejected alternatives**.

---

## ADR-1: The Elm Architecture (TEA)

**Choice**: All state lives in a single `App` model.
Events become messages, `update()` applies them,
`view()` renders the result.

**Why**: TEA makes state transitions explicit and testable.
Every input has a traceable path from event to screen change.
There's no hidden state scattered across components, which matters
when multiple PTY sessions are producing concurrent output.

**Rejected**:

- *Component-based (each panel owns state)* — leads to
  synchronization bugs when sessions interact.
- *Ad-hoc event handlers* — untraceable control flow;
  hard to reason about as the app grows.

## ADR-2: PTY pipeline — portable-pty + vt100 + tui-term

**Choice**: `portable-pty` spawns the `claude` CLI,
`vt100::Parser` interprets escape sequences,
`tui_term::PseudoTerminal` renders the parsed screen into ratatui.

**Why**: Each crate handles exactly one concern. `portable-pty`
abstracts platform differences (Linux, macOS). `vt100` gives us a
full in-memory terminal state we can query without scraping.
`tui_term` bridges that state to ratatui widgets
with zero custom rendering code.

**Rejected**:

- *`nix::pty` directly* — Linux-only;
  would require a separate Windows/macOS backend.
- *`alacritty_terminal`* — full terminal emulator,
  far heavier than needed.
  We don't need font rendering or GPU acceleration.
- *Parsing raw ANSI ourselves* — error-prone,
  massive surface area, already solved by `vt100`.

## ADR-3: Async — tokio multi-threaded + spawn_blocking

**Choice**: The app runs on tokio's multi-threaded runtime.
PTY read loops run inside `spawn_blocking`
(blocking I/O in a threadpool), while PTY write and event handling
run in `tokio::spawn` (async).

**Why**: PTY reads are blocking by nature
(`read()` on a file descriptor). Putting them in `spawn_blocking`
prevents stalling the async executor. The writer side is naturally
async — it awaits messages from an mpsc channel
and writes when they arrive.

**Rejected**:

- *Single-threaded tokio* — PTY reads would block the entire
  runtime, freezing the UI.
- *`std::thread` for everything* — works but loses tokio's
  structured concurrency, select!, and channel ergonomics.

---

## ADR-4: Input translation — crossterm KeyCode to xterm ANSI

**Choice**: `input.rs` maps crossterm `KeyCode`/`KeyModifiers`
to raw xterm ANSI byte sequences before writing to the PTY.

**Why**: crossterm gives us structured key events.
PTYs expect raw bytes. The translation layer is explicit and
testable — each key has a known byte sequence, and edge cases
(arrow keys, function keys, modifier combos)
are handled in one place.

**Rejected**:

- *Raw passthrough (forward crossterm's raw bytes)* —
  crossterm's internal byte representation doesn't match xterm
  sequences. Modifier keys, in particular, would break.

---

## ADR-5: Responsive layout breakpoints

**Choice**: Three layout tiers based on terminal width:

- `<80 cols` — terminal panel only (full screen)
- `>=80 cols` — two panels (session list + terminal)
- `>=120 cols` — three panels (session list + terminal + info)

**Why**: 80 columns is the smallest usable terminal width. Below
that, showing a sidebar wastes too much space. At 120+, there's
room for supplementary info without shrinking the terminal panel
below readable width. Fixed breakpoints are predictable — the
layout never "jitters" near a threshold.

**Rejected**:

- *Fixed layout (always 3 panels)* — unusable on small terminals.
- *User-configurable breakpoints* — premature complexity.
  Can be added later if needed.

---

## ADR-6: File-based logging only

**Choice**: All tracing output goes to
`~/.local/share/thurbox/thurbox.log`.
Nothing writes to stdout or stderr.

**Why**: The TUI owns stdout entirely. Any stray `println!` or
log line to stdout would corrupt the terminal display. File-based
logging also makes it easy to `tail -f` the log in a second
terminal while developing.

**Rejected**:

- *Stderr logging* — crossterm's alternate screen captures stderr
  on some platforms, still risks display corruption.
- *In-app log panel* — useful eventually, but adds complexity
  before the core features are stable.

## ADR-7: Build profiles

| Profile | `opt-level` | LTO | Strip | Debug | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dev` | 0 | off | no | yes | Fast iteration |
| `test` | 1 | off | no | yes | Faster tests, still debuggable |
| `release` | 3 | full | yes | no | Distribution binary |
| `release-with-debug` | 3 | full | no | yes | Profiling / flamegraph |

**Why**: `test` at opt-level 1 catches optimization-dependent bugs
earlier while keeping compile times reasonable. The release profile
strips everything for a minimal binary. `release-with-debug` exists
specifically for `perf` / `flamegraph` workflows.
